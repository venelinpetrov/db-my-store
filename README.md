## ToC

1. [PRD](documents/PRD.md) - Summary of the requirements given by the imaginary Product team
2. [RnD notes](documents/RnD_Notes.md) - all notes during development (a decision diary)
3. [Diagrams](diagrams/)
4. [Scripts](scripts/) - the SQL scripts for creating and populating the Store DB

The database includes support for:

- Customers and addresses (with address types)
- Products, categories, and images
- Product variants (e.g., size, color, style)
- Variant option modeling with flexible assignment
- Inventory and pricing (variant-level)
- Extensible support for orders, payments, and invoices


This exercise simulates a real-world commerce platform architecture. It emphasizes:

- Clean **normalization**
- Flexible, **extensible design**
- Support for **complex product configurations**

## Seed script

## Tech Stack

- **MySQL** (developed using MySQL Workbench / DBeaver)
- Easily adaptable to PostgreSQL or other RDBMS
- Great for SQL-focused back-end learning

## Use Cases

- SQL schema design practice
- Learning normalization and relationships
- Building mock data for testing or query challenges
- Interview preparation
- Foundation for a full-stack store app
